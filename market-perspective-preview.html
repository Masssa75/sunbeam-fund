        <!-- Option 1 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Option 1: Conversational & Direct</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>November feels like ancient history now. Bitcoin's holding steady while everything else got crushed - we're talking 70-80% down for most altcoins, and don't even get me started on memecoins.</p>
                <p>Between the tariff wars, Middle East tensions, and inflation that just won't quit, nobody knows what's coming next. The uncertainty is real.</p>
                <p>Here's the thing though - while everyone's panicking, Kaspa is still cranking out blocks faster than ever. Bittensor's AI network keeps growing. Sui's ready for whatever comes next. We're not here to flip memecoins. We're building positions in the infrastructure that'll power the next decade.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Option 2 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-600 mb-3">Option 2: Straightforward & Honest</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>Let's be real - it's been brutal out there since November. Most altcoins are down 70%+, memecoins got absolutely destroyed, and even the strongest projects are bleeding.</p>
                <p>With tariff wars, Middle East conflicts, and stubborn inflation, everyone's on edge. Nobody has a crystal ball right now.</p>
                <p>But here's what hasn't changed: the technology we're invested in. Kaspa's still the fastest blockchain out there. Bittensor's AI marketplace grows every day. These aren't pump-and-dump coins - they're the rails the future runs on.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Option 3 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-600 mb-3">Option 3: Reassuring & Forward-Looking</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>Markets are tough right now - no sugarcoating it. Since November, we've seen massive drawdowns across crypto while the world deals with tariff wars, Middle East tensions, and inflation that won't budge.</p>
                <p>The uncertainty is palpable. But uncertainty creates opportunity for those who see beyond the noise.</p>
                <p>Our projects aren't just surviving - they're building. Kaspa's speed advantage, Bittensor's AI network, Sui's scalability - these fundamentals don't disappear in a downturn. We're positioned for what comes after the storm.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Option 4 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-3">Option 4: Matter-of-Fact & Confident</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>Since November: Bitcoin sideways, altcoins down 70-80%, memecoins obliterated. Add in tariff wars, Middle East conflicts, and sticky inflation - it's the perfect storm of uncertainty.</p>
                <p>But zoom out. Kaspa's still processing more transactions per second than any other POW chain. Bittensor's AI network keeps expanding. Sui's infrastructure is battle-tested and ready.</p>
                <p>We don't chase pumps. We own the infrastructure. That's the difference between surviving and thriving.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Option 5 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-red-600 mb-3">Option 5: Personal & Relatable</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>I won't lie - watching the market since November has been painful. While Bitcoin treads water, most altcoins are down 70%+ and memecoins... well, let's just say they lived up to their name.</p>
                <p>Between unprecedented tariff wars, Middle East tensions, and inflation that refuses to cooperate, everyone's asking 'what's next?' Truth is, nobody knows.</p>
                <p>What I do know: Kaspa's still the fastest. Bittensor's AI network grows daily. Sui's ready for mass adoption. We didn't buy these for a quick flip - we bought them because they're building the future.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Option 6 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-600 mb-3">Option 6: Educational & Perspective-Driven</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>November marked a turning point. While Bitcoin demonstrated its 'digital gold' status by holding relatively steady, the altcoin market experienced a reality check - down 70-80% across the board. Memecoins? Even worse.</p>
                <p>Global uncertainty dominates: tariff wars, Middle East conflicts, persistent inflation. It's a cocktail of fear.</p>
                <p>Yet infrastructure marches on. Kaspa processes blocks at record speeds. Bittensor's decentralized AI grows steadily. Sui scales effortlessly. History shows: speculation dies in bear markets, but real innovation accelerates.</p>

        <!-- Current Version for Comparison -->
        <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-300 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mb-3">Current Version (for comparison)</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3 opacity-75">
                <p>The crypto market has experienced extraordinary headwinds since the November peak, with the broader altcoin market down 90% while Bitcoin has held relatively stable. Global factors including new tariff policies, Middle East tensions, and persistent inflation concerns have created the most challenging environment since 2022.</p>
                <p>In this context, our portfolio's performance represents a significant outperformance versus the altcoin market. This resilience stems from our focus on infrastructure projects with real utility rather than speculative assets.</p>
                <p>The technology fundamentals remain unchanged. Kaspa continues processing blocks at unprecedented speeds. Bittensor's AI marketplace grows daily. Sui's throughput capabilities position it for the next adoption wave. While we aim to capture bull market peaks, our focus on fundamental infrastructure ensures our projects survive and build through bear markets, unlike speculative assets that disappear entirely.</p>
