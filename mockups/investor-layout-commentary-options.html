            <div class="commentary-content">
                <p>The crypto market has experienced <span class="commentary-highlight">extraordinary headwinds</span> since the November peak, with the broader altcoin market down 90% while Bitcoin has held relatively stable. Global factors including new tariff policies, Middle East tensions, and persistent inflation concerns have created the most challenging environment since 2022.</p>
                
                <p>In this context, our portfolio's -40% performance represents a <span class="commentary-highlight">50% outperformance</span> versus the altcoin market. This resilience stems from our focus on infrastructure projects with real utility rather than speculative assets.</p>
                
                <p>The technology fundamentals remain unchanged. Kaspa continues processing blocks at unprecedented speeds. Bittensor's AI marketplace grows daily. Sui's throughput capabilities position it for the next adoption wave. <span class="commentary-highlight">We invest for 3-5 year horizons</span>, allowing us to weather these storms.</p>
                
                <p>History shows that the most significant returns come to those who maintain conviction through downturns. <span class="commentary-highlight">Chainlink: $0.30 → $52 (173x). Polygon: $0.003 → $2.92 (973x). Ethereum: $80 → $4,800 (60x).</span> Each survived the 2018-2019 depths to deliver extraordinary returns. Today's prices may represent a similar opportunity.</p>

                <p>History validates this approach. Quality projects have consistently rewarded patient investors through cycles. Consider Chainlink <span class="inline-example">$0.30→$52</span>, or how Ethereum recovered from <span class="inline-example">$80→$4,800</span> after 2018's capitulation. Even younger projects like Polygon delivered <span class="inline-example">973x</span> returns to those who held through uncertainty. Today's environment, while painful, follows a familiar pattern.</p>
