# Telegram Bot "Not Configured" Fix Summary

## Issue
The admin panel was showing "Telegram bot not configured" when trying to send test messages, even though the bot was set up and the token was in the Supabase Edge Function secrets.

## Root Cause
The Next.js API route (`/api/telegram/test/route.ts`) was checking for `process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, but this environment variable wasn't available in the production Next.js deployment. The token was only stored in Supabase Edge Function secrets.

## Solution Implemented
Modified the API route to call the Supabase Edge Function (`send-telegram-notification`) instead of trying to access the bot token directly. The Edge Function has secure access to the token via Supabase secrets.

### Changes Made:
1. **Modified `/src/app/api/telegram/test/route.ts`**:
   - Removed direct bot token check
   - Now calls the Edge Function at `https://[project-id].supabase.co/functions/v1/send-telegram-notification`
   - Uses service role key for authentication
   - Delegates all Telegram operations to the Edge Function

2. **GET endpoint simplified**:
   - Returns only database information (connected investors count)
   - Bot info and webhook status are noted as "managed in Edge Functions"

## Alternative Solution (Not Implemented)
If you prefer to keep the bot token in the Next.js app:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with the value from `.env`
3. Redeploy the site

However, the current solution (using Edge Functions) is more secure as it keeps the bot token in Supabase's secure environment.

## Testing
The fix has been deployed. To verify:
1. Go to https://sunbeam.capital/admin/telegram
2. Try sending a test message
3. It should now work without the "not configured" error

## Edge Function Details
- **Function**: `send-telegram-notification`
- **URL**: `https://gualxudgbmpuhjbumfeh.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-telegram-notification`
- **Secrets**: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is stored in Supabase secrets
- **Authentication**: Requires service role key in Authorization header
