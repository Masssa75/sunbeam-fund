                Our approach remains consistent: focus on infrastructure that matters. Kaspa processes transactions faster than any proof-of-work chain. Bittensor connects AI models in ways traditional tech can't. Toncoin leverages Telegram's billion users. <span class="font-medium text-black">We see these as foundational technologies</span>, not momentum trades. They're built to operate through cycles, not just ride them.

        <!-- Option 1 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Option 1: Revolutionary Focus</h2>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                We don't invest in "faster coins" or copies of copies. We seek the rare projects solving crypto's fundamental limitations. Kaspa isn't just another blockchain—it's a complete reimagining that achieves Bitcoin's security at thousands of times the speed. Bittensor creates unstoppable AI markets no corporation can control. Toncoin could onboard a billion users overnight. <span class="font-medium text-black">These aren't incremental improvements; they're paradigm shifts</span>. In a sea of 20,000 cryptocurrencies, perhaps a dozen truly matter. We own three of them.
            </p>

        <!-- Option 2 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-600 mb-3">Option 2: Problem-Solution Narrative</h2>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Crypto has a dirty secret: most projects can't scale without sacrificing decentralization. We invest only in those solving this core dilemma. Kaspa rewrote blockchain's rules—transforming the linear chain into a graph that processes thousands of transactions per second while staying fully decentralized. Bittensor harnesses decentralization to build an AI network no single entity can shut down. Toncoin bridges crypto's biggest gap: actual users. <span class="font-medium text-black">We're not betting on coins. We're betting on revolutions</span>—the handful of projects that make centralized alternatives obsolete.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Option 3 -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-600 mb-3">Option 3: Direct & Bold</h2>
            <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Here's our filter: Does this project make something previously impossible, possible? Kaspa makes instant, decentralized payments real—something Bitcoin promised but couldn't deliver at scale. Bittensor enables AI models to collaborate without corporate gatekeepers. Toncoin puts crypto in the pockets of a billion people who don't even know they're using it. <span class="font-medium text-black">Most crypto projects are solutions looking for problems. Ours are revolutions waiting to happen</span>. When the market grasps what we already see, the repricing will be violent.
