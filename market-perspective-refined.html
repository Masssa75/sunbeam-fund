        <!-- Option A -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Option A: Streamlined Current Version</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>Since November's peak, the crypto market has faced significant headwinds. While Bitcoin has remained relatively stable, the broader altcoin market has declined 70-80%, with meme coins experiencing even steeper losses.</p>
                <p>Global uncertainties—unprecedented tariff policies, Middle East conflicts, and persistent inflation—have created the most challenging environment since 2022. Market participants face genuine uncertainty about near-term direction.</p>
                <p>In this context, our portfolio has demonstrated meaningful resilience. This stems from our focus on infrastructure projects with proven utility rather than speculative assets. Kaspa continues processing blocks at record speeds. Bittensor's AI marketplace expands daily. Sui maintains its scalability advantage. These technological fundamentals remain intact, positioning our investments to both weather current conditions and capture future growth.</p>

        <!-- Option B -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-green-600 mb-3">Option B: Cleaner Structure</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>The crypto market has experienced substantial pressure since November. Bitcoin has held steady, but altcoins are down 70-80% broadly, with speculative sectors hit hardest.</p>
                <p>Three factors drive current uncertainty: escalating tariff disputes, Middle East instability, and inflation that remains stubbornly elevated. Together, they've created conditions reminiscent of 2022's challenges.</p>
                <p>Our portfolio's relative strength reflects deliberate positioning in foundational infrastructure. Kaspa maintains its speed advantage. Bittensor's decentralized AI network grows consistently. Sui's throughput remains unmatched. While markets cycle between fear and optimism, these core technologies continue advancing—a crucial distinction from purely speculative investments.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Option C -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-600 mb-3">Option C: Focused & Direct</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>November marked a sharp reversal. Bitcoin has largely held its ground while altcoins have declined 70-80%, with meme coins suffering particularly severe losses.</p>
                <p>The macro environment compounds crypto-specific challenges: trade conflicts escalate, geopolitical tensions persist, and inflation proves more durable than anticipated. Uncertainty prevails.</p>
                <p>Yet our core thesis remains valid. We've invested in projects solving real problems: Kaspa's unprecedented transaction speed, Bittensor's AI compute marketplace, Sui's enterprise-grade scalability. These aren't speculative bets—they're infrastructure plays. The technology continues improving regardless of market sentiment, positioning us for both preservation and opportunity.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Option D -->
        <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-3">Option D: Balanced Perspective</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3">
                <p>The market environment has shifted dramatically since November. While Bitcoin demonstrates relative stability, the altcoin sector has contracted 70-80%, with speculative assets experiencing the sharpest declines.</p>
                <p>Multiple headwinds converge: unprecedented tariff tensions, ongoing Middle East conflicts, and inflation that defies expectations. This confluence creates genuine uncertainty—the most challenging conditions since 2022.</p>
                <p>Our positioning in fundamental infrastructure provides important advantages. Kaspa processes transactions at unmatched speeds. Bittensor's AI network expands its capabilities daily. Sui delivers consistent performance at scale. Unlike speculative assets that vanish in downturns, these projects continue building essential technology. This focus on lasting value guides our approach through both corrections and expansions.</p>

        <!-- Current Version for Comparison -->
        <div class="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-300 p-6 mb-6">
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-600 mb-3">Current Version (for comparison)</h2>
            <div class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-3 opacity-75">
                <p>The crypto market has experienced extraordinary headwinds since the November peak, with the broader altcoin market down 90% while Bitcoin has held relatively stable. Global factors including new tariff policies, Middle East tensions, and persistent inflation concerns have created the most challenging environment since 2022.</p>
                <p>In this context, our portfolio's performance represents a significant outperformance versus the altcoin market. This resilience stems from our focus on infrastructure projects with real utility rather than speculative assets.</p>
                <p>The technology fundamentals remain unchanged. Kaspa continues processing blocks at unprecedented speeds. Bittensor's AI marketplace grows daily. Sui's throughput capabilities position it for the next adoption wave. While we aim to capture bull market peaks, our focus on fundamental infrastructure ensures our projects survive and build through bear markets, unlike speculative assets that disappear entirely.</p>
